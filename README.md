# **Real-Time Defect Detection and Classification for Canned Food Packaging**

Hi! This project is a **real-time defect detection and classification system** specifically designed for detecting defects in **canned food packaging** using **YOLOv8** (You Only Look Once, Version 8), the **Ultralytics** library, and **OpenCV**.

This system leverages the **YOLOv8 model** to identify and classify defects with high accuracy and efficiency, enabling quality control processes in real-time. The combination of YOLOv8 and OpenCV ensures that **defects in canned packaging are detected swiftly and precisely**, making it ideal for **automated inspection** in manufacturing environments.

## **Features**
- **Real-Time Detection**: Identifies and classifies defects as they appear.
- **Focused on Canned Food Packaging**: Optimized for detecting defects in specific packaging scenarios.
- **High-Accuracy Model**: Powered by YOLOv8 from Ultralytics for reliable results.
- **Efficient Image Processing**: Utilizes OpenCV for handling and processing image frames.

## **Requirements**
- **Python**
- **[Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)**
- **OpenCV**
- **Flask**

## **Getting Started**
1. **Clone the repository**.
2. **Install the required dependencies**.
3. **Run the application** with `python app.py` to start real-time defect detection.
