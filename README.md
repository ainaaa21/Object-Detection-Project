# 🛠️ Real-Time Defect Detection and Classification for Canned Food Packaging

## 🚀 **Exploring AI in Quality Control**

This is a personal project developed to demonstrate a practical understanding of AI, deep learning, and computer vision by building a prototype for real-time defect detection in canned food packaging. Leveraging YOLOv8 by Ultralytics and OpenCV, the system simulates an automated quality control process—showcasing the potential of AI in manufacturing and inspection tasks.  

## 🔍 Project Objectives

✅ **Hands-On Deep Learning** – Apply object detection techniques to a real-world use case.  
✅ **Real-Time Processing** – Demonstrate the ability to detect and classify defects instantly.  
✅ **Practical Application Focus** – Tailored for packaging defects like dents, scratches, and deformations.  
✅ **Web Deployment Simulation** – Use Flask to simulate deployment in a production-like environment.
